	<h3 class="clearFix"><img class="floatRalph" src="images/hands_cocoa.jpg">Interestingly, most of chocolate&#39;s long history was only in beverage form, with no sugar. In fact, one archaeological excavation in Honduras found pottery from 1400 BC with cocoa residue. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe. Yet, it remained mostly something for the privileged few. A little over 100 years later the industrial revolution made higher level of production possible.</h3>

And soon after that solid chocolate was created.  Joseph Frye made the first bar in 1847. Remarkably, chocolate was included in soldier&#39;s rations in the Revolutionary War. Throughout its centuries-long evolution, one factor has remained consistent and cocoa has attracted devotees worldwide. Today, over 4.5 million tons of cocoa beans are consumed annually around the globe, in everything from drinks to candy bars. It&#39;s safe to say that the ancient Mesoamericans who pioneered the crop could never have imagined the popularity cocoa would someday experience.
