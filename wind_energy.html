		<h3>
		Iowa Among Leaders in the Nation in Wind Energy Production
		</h3>
		
		<p>
		Making up 42% of the state's generated electricity in 2019, wind power is the largest source of electricity generation in Iowa. In 2019, over <strong>26 billion</strong> kWh of electrical energy was generated by wind power. As of Q1 2020, Iowa has over 10,664 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity with 5,590 wind turbines, <strong><em>ranking 2nd and 3rd in the nation</em></strong> below Texas respectively.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The development of wind power in Iowa began with a state law, enacted in 1983, requiring investor-owned utilities in the state to purchase 105 MW of power from wind generation. Former governor Terry Branstad stated that by 2020 the percentage of wind generated electricity in Iowa could reach 40 percent. This goal has been exceeded, with <strong>over 40 percent</strong> of Iowa's electricity being generated from the wind as of October 2019 according to the Energy Information Administration, a first in the nation accomplishment.<br>
		<br>
		<q><em>Iowa derives a greater percentage of its electricity from wind than any other state, and we are second in the nation in the number of people employed in the wind industry. Thanks to our low electricity prices and commitment to renewable energy, major tech companies and other energy-intensive businesses are interested in locating and expanding facilities here, which is good economic news for all Iowans.</em></q> <br>
		Gov. Terry Brandstad, in the Des Moines Register.

		Based on the latest (October 09, 2018) Obstruction Database from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), there were 4,211 wind turbines in Iowa, including 182 new turbines installed this year. The database indicates 60 Iowa counties have wind turbines installed. Some wind turbine facts are as follows:
		<ul>
		<li>The windmills are approximately 26 stories tall</li>
		<li>Blades are as wide as the wingspan of a jumbo jet</li>
		<li>The towers weigh about 57 tons</li>
		<li>Each blade weighs about 8,000 pounds</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		Without energy from Iowa&apos;s wind turbines, <strong><em>CEO of Apple, Tim Cook</em></strong>, says his company would not have chosen Iowa as the site for two new data centers. The two new data centers will create numerous jobs for people in Iowa and continue to support Iowa&apos;s wind industry. Approximately 50 full time employees will work in the data center, along with roughly 500 jobs created during the construction process. Apple will spend nearly <em>$1.4 billion</em> on construction of the new project. The City of Waukee voted and approved to provide more than $200 million dollars worth of tax breaks, with other tax incentives to Apple, after the completion of data centers.
