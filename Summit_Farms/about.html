		<h3>Alaskan Husky</h3>
		<p>
		The Alaskan Husky is a sled dog bred for working ability, not looks or pedigree, and there’s no set formula for creating him. He is usually bred from various spitz-type dogs and has their characteristic prick ears, but in all other respects his looks vary widely. His usually short to medium-length coat can be any color or pattern, and he may have the wedge-shaped head of a spitz breed or a face with a longer muzzle. He is usually a medium-size dog, weighing 38 to 50 pounds. Alaskan Huskies are built for different types of sledding: some are freighters, pulling heavy loads; some are sprinters, going quickly over short distances; and some are long-distance runners.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Alaskan Malamute</h3>
		<p>
		The Malamute is generally slower in long-distance sled racing against smaller and faster breeds as their working usefulness is limited to travelling over long distances but at a far slower rate than that required for racing. The Malamute is one of the most unaltered of breeds, retaining its original form and function. Their affectionate nature does not make them useful as watch or guard Dogs. If a Dog owner cannot cope with a Dog that will not comply with the owner's every command, a more compliant breed should be selected. They are however, pure pack animals as this breed has a long genetic foundation of living in the wilderness with man, surrounded by other domesticated animals of approximately the same size.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Alaskan Klee Kai</h3>
		<p>
		The Alaskan klee kai is an intelligent, high-activity dog. However, they are not "hyper." Unlike other husky breeds, they are highly trainable and make good watchdogs. Also unlike their cousins, they are suspicious of strangers. They require their owner's attention and are most likely found at their owner's side. They "talk back" and howl, but are not excessive barkers. Occasionally, a klee kai will be people-shy. This temperament is considered undesirable and dogs with this temperament are neutered. Klee kai need a moderate amount of exercise. Because of their intelligence, they can become escape artists. If unhappy, the klee kai can escape through fences. Klee kai have a sense of humor and may play tricks on their owner. They excel in the sport of dog agility.
		</p>
		
		<h3>American Eskimo</h3>
		<p>
		The American Eskimo is a family dog. Eskies are very loyal and need to be around their owners. They are highly intelligent, but can be stubborn. They make good watchdogs, but are prone to excessive barking. They must be socialized with people or they can become overly wary of strangers. With proper socialization along with a proper introduction, Eskies warm up to strangers and accept them good-naturedly. An Eskie only needs a moderate amount of exercise, but needs plenty of things to do, or it will find something to do. Like all intelligent dogs, they can become bored and may dig or chew in an effort to entertain themselves. These dogs are smart and capable of Houdini-like escapes if not properly confined.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Siberian Husky</h3>
		<p>
		Siberian Huskies are probably best-known for their incredible sled-pulling skills, but these doggies aren't all business! They indeed make excellent working dogs—they were originally bred to help the Chukchi people of Siberia hunt more efficiently—but they're seriously sweet, friendly, and loyal cuddle bugs, too. From their distinctive, wolf-like appearance, bright blue eyes, and fascinating history, there's a lot to learn—and love!
		</p>
		
		<h3>Samoyed</h3>
		<p>
		The Samoyed is a friendly, personable dog. These are intelligent dogs, with a touch of independence. Bred to live in a tent in very close quarters with their families, they thrive on human company. Samoyeds will alarm bark and, if left alone for long periods of time, will often develop into nuisance barkers. Digging can be a problem because they dig to reach a cool resting place. Samoyeds tend to get along well with other dogs as well as people and with other pets they are raised with. They are herding dogs and may show some tendency to chase or nip. In general, they get along well with children, although they can be a little boisterous for small toddlers.

		<h3>Greenland</h3>
		<p>
		A powerful-looking breed, the Greenland Dog possesses a heavy frame, bushy tail, feathered legs and small, triangular ears. Its profuse double coat aids the dog's survival, protecting internal organs from -50 to -75 degree colds. The curved tail serves to shield the dog's face while it is sleeping. Typically independent and with a natural tendency to exercise alpha behaviours, the Greenland Dog requires firm leadership and consistent training from an early age. That said, the breed is adaptable to domestic life and is a suitable breed choice for active families or the dedicated sole owner. Loyal, obedient and protective of home and property, the Greenland Dog makes a great addition to any home setting, providing its needs are met. Generally, a healthy Greenland Dog will weigh 30-32 kg, with a life expectancy of 10-12 years when cared for accordingly.

		<h3>Seppala Siberian Sled Dog</h3>
		<p>
		This breed has a medium sized body, with a long head, a pair of almond-shaped eyes, and a dark nose. They have well-developed shoulder, neck and chest muscles, which helps them to work efficiently as a working dog. These dogs have a tremendous amount of energy, especially when they are young. This breed frequently growls, especially when struck by boredom and canine depression. They will be good with other canines and animals, if raised with them, in early puppyhood. This breed will love to hang out with its owner, especially during lazy winter evenings.
