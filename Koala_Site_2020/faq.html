		<strong>What does a Koala bear look like?</strong>
		<br><br>Koalas have soft, thick grey or brown fur on their backs and white fur on their stomachs. The farther south the koala lives, the thicker its fur is. This is because southern Australia is colder than northern Australia. Koalas do not have a tail, but do have strong, sharp claws that help them climb and maneuver through the treetops. Their front paws have two thumbs that allow them to have a firmer grasp on branches. The back paws have two joined toes that are used for grooming. The koalaâ€™s fur helps it camouflage, and its climbing abilities allow it to escape predators.

		<strong>What is the average lifespan of a koala?</strong>
		<br>Koalas can live as long as 17 years, although high mortality rates (due to car fatalities and dogs) for males lower their life expectancy to 2 to 10 years.

		<strong>How do Koala's behave?</strong>

		<strong>How do Koala's populate?</strong>
		<br>Koalas breed once a year. Gestation lasts 35 days, after which one koala is born. The baby koala is very small when it is born, and lives in its mother's pouch for five to seven months. After this time, koalas gradually become independent and survive on their own.

		<strong>What are some major threats of Koala's?</strong>
		<br>Once numbering in the millions, koalas suffered major declines in population during the 1920s when they were hunted for their fur. Today, habitat destruction, traffic deaths, and attacks by dogs kill an estimated 4,000 koalas yearly.
